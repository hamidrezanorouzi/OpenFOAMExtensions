Model Description:

This model uses the EMMS approach to modify the GidaspowErgunWenYu model in order to correctly predict the drag force in gas-solid systems.

This model is developed by Shi et al. (2011) for the studied fluidized bed in Zhu et al. (2008) paper.

Fluidized bed properties:

Bed diameter: 0.267 m 

Particle Geldart type: A
Particle Diameter: 65e-6 m
Particle Density: 1780 kg/m3

Gas superficial velocity: 0.2 m/s
